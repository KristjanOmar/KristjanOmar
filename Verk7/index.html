            <p><b><i>Subnautica</i></b> is an open-world exploration action-horror video game developed and published by Unknown Worlds Entertainment. The game has the player as a non-essential systems maintenance chief who is the only survivor of a spaceship crash on an alien planet. The player's main objectives are to find essential resources, survive the local flora and fauna, and build a rocket to escape the planet.</p>

            <p><i>Subnautica</i> was released in early access for Microsoft Windows in December 2014, macOS in June 2015, and for Xbox One in May 2016. It was released out of early access in January 2018 for Microsoft Windows and macOS, with versions for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in December 2018. The physical console versions were published by Gearbox Publishing. The Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S versions were released in May 2021.</p>

            <p>By January 2020, more than five million copies had been sold. A sequel, Subnautica: Below Zero, was released May 14, 2021.</p>

        <p>The game mainly adheres to young, curious people that wish to explore the deepest deeps of an ocean filled to the brim with magnificent creatures. The game also brings in people with a keen interest in marine biology and the secrets of the ocean. As with most video games, the demographics of Subnautica are more male-oriented, but exploration has no gender, and so there does still exist a sizable female playerbase.</p>

            <p>Subnautica was announced by Unknown Worlds Entertainment on December 17, 2013, with Charlie Cleveland as the director and lead gameplay programmer, and Hugh Jeremy as the producer. The music is composed by Simon Chylinski.</p>

            <p>Cleveland was heavily inspired by Minecraft, which he noted "transformed the game industry" and "threw away all traditional challenge oriented and progression oriented games". The release of Minecraft overlapped with Unknown Worlds releasing Natural Selection 2. Feeling exhausted, the team wanted to try something new and decided to make such a game. Other influences included scuba diving, the filmography of James Cameron, and "just the feeling of exploring the deep, dark, alternately beautiful and terrible, ocean depths. Feeling like I'm an explorer, almost an astronaut, not knowing what I'll find". Cleveland did not initially view it as a survival game but as an exploration game.</p>

            <p>The development team opted to use the Unity engine rather than Spark, the engine used for the company's previous game, Natural Selection 2. Subnautica producer Hugh Jeremy justified this decision because of the different demands that the game places on the engine, and "because [the team] does not include people working on Spark, it's not appropriate for Subnautica to use Spark. By using Unity for Subnautica, Spark can continue to develop in certain directions, while Subnautica develops in others. To use Spark for Subnautica would be like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole."</p>
